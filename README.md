MolKGNN is a deep learning model based on Grah Neural Networks (GNNs) for molecular representation learning. It features in:
1. SE(3)-invariance
2. Conformation-invariance
3. Interpretability

# Acquire the Datasets

This repository does NOT include the datasets used in the experiment. Please download the datasets from [this link](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Well-curated_QSAR_datasets_for_diverse_protein_targets/20539893)

These are well-curated realistic datasets that removes false positves for a diverse important drug targets. The datasets also feature in its high imbalance nature (much more inactive molecules than active ones). Original papers of the datasets: see references [1,2]. 

**Introduction of the Datasets**

High-throughput screening (HTS) is the use of automated equipment to rapidly screen thousands to millions of molecules for the biological activity of interest in the early drug discovery process [3]. However, this brute-force approach has low hit rates, typically around 0.05\%-0.5\% [4]. Meanwhile, PubChem [5] is a database supported by the National Institute of Health (NIH) that contains biological activities for millions of drug-like molecules, often from HTS experiments. However, the raw primary screening data from the PubChem have a high false positive rate [6]. A series of secondary experimental screens on putative actives is used to remove these. While all relevant screens are linked, the datasets of molecules are often not curated to list all inactive molecules from the primary HTS and only confirmed actives after secondary screening. Thus, we identified nine high-quality HTS experiments in PubChem covering all important target protein classes for drug discovery. We carefully curated these datasets to have lists of inactive and confirmed active molecules. 

**Statistics of the Datasets, specified by PubChem Assay ID (AID)**

# Process the Datasets


Uncompress the downloaded file and you will see several .sdf files. Create a folders according to the diagram below. Place all .sdf files **<em>raw</em>** folder. 
You can use the `dataset_multigenerator.py` to process all of them in parallel into [PyG's InMemoryDataset](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/create_dataset.html), as shown below.

`python dataset_multigenerator.py`

The processed data will appear in the **<em>processed</em>** folder
